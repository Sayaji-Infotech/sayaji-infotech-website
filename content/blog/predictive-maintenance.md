# Predictive Maintenance at L&T

In the ever-evolving industrial landscape, machine downtime can be a costly affair. At L&T Hazira, we successfully implemented a predictive maintenance system that leverages cutting-edge technology to ensure operational efficiency and minimize unexpected machine breakdowns.

## What We Achieved
Predictive maintenance allows us to foresee potential machine failures before they occur, enabling proactive intervention. By identifying the root cause of issues through smart algorithms, we can prevent breakdowns, reduce downtime, and optimize performance. This intelligent approach ensures machines remain in peak condition, translating to significant cost savings and enhanced productivity.

## How We Achieved It
Our predictive maintenance system integrates sensors, smart algorithms, and real-time monitoring to create a seamless and efficient solution. Here’s how it works:

1. **Sensor Integration**: Each machine is equipped with a variety of sensors to capture vital parameters, including:
   - Vibration
   - Temperature
   - Pressure and many more

2. **Data Processing**: The sensor data is transmitted in real-time to a **LimePi Zero**, a compact yet powerful custom made gateway device. This device acts as the cornerstone of our predictive maintenance system, running algorithms to process the data every second.

3. **Anomaly Detection**: Our custom-built algorithms analyze the incoming data to detect any anomalies. When irregularities are identified, the system automatically triggers alarms and alerts, notifying operators about potential issues.

4. **Real-Time Monitoring**: The processed data is visualized on a custom-built web application. This platform offers:
   - Real-time monitoring of all critical machine parameters.
   - User-friendly dashboards with innovative data visualization.
   - Historical data analysis to identify patterns and trends.

5. **Proactive Maintenance**: Armed with actionable insights, maintenance teams can address root causes before a breakdown occurs, ensuring smooth operations and extending the lifespan of critical machinery.

## User Interface: A Seamless Experience
The custom web application is designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind. Operators can monitor machines in real-time through an intuitive dashboard. Key features include:

### Dashboard and Sensor Data

The application's dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the sensor data, including current values, health weightage, and sample times. The interface allows for easy navigation and detailed analysis of each sensor's performance.

### Health History

The health history section offers a detailed view of the machine's health index over time. This historical data is crucial for long-term analysis and improving predictive accuracy.

### Sensor Details

Detailed information about each sensor, including its address, current value, and type, is readily available. This allows for precise monitoring and quick response to any anomalies.
