At Sayaji Infotech, we are committed to building transformative technology solutions that redefine industries. Recently, we implemented an intelligent resume scanning and candidate matching system for SearchEnds, delivering a cutting-edge recruitment platform powered by automation, AI, and semantic search.

## *Key Features of the Resume Scanning System*

### *1. Automated Resume Processing*
Our system efficiently processes large volumes of PDF resumes from a designated folder. A scheduler automatically scans and analyzes the resumes, saving valuable time for HR teams and ensuring no potential candidate is overlooked.

### *2. AI-Powered Data Extraction*
By integrating Gemini AI, the system intelligently extracts critical information from diverse resume formats. It transforms unstructured data into a standardized schema capturing names, skills, experience, and other relevant details, ensuring consistent evaluation criteria across candidates.

### *3. Advanced Semantic Search Capabilities*
The platform leverages OpenSearch to provide powerful semantic search functionality. This enables hiring managers to find candidates whose experience and skills align closely with job requirements, going beyond basic keyword matching.

### *4. Comprehensive Database Management*
All extracted data is structured into a consistent JSON format and stored in an OpenSearch database. This architecture ensures fast retrieval, efficient filtering, and accurate ranking of candidates based on relevance.

### *5. Intuitive User Interface for Analysis*
A custom-built React frontend displays detailed insights and analytics. The user-friendly interface empowers hiring managers to define search criteria, view comprehensive candidate profiles, and make informed decisions.

## *Impact Delivered*

Our solution enabled:

* *Enhanced Efficiency*: Dramatically reduced resume screening time through automation.
* *Improved Accuracy*: Increased precision in candidate matching with AI-powered semantic search.
* *Seamless Collaboration*: Facilitated better team collaboration through save, share, and edit functionalities.

## *Our Technical Approach*

1. **Frappe Backend**: We built a powerful and scalable backend on the Frappe framework.
2. **React Frontend**: Developed a responsive and intuitive frontend using React.js.
3. **Gemini AI Integration**: Used advanced AI to extract structured data from unstructured resume files.
4. **OpenSearch Database**: Enabled context-aware candidate searches with semantic capabilities.

## *A Glimpse into the Application*

The web dashboard brings everything together with:

* *Dynamic Search Forms*: Define custom candidate search criteria with ease.
* *Intelligent Result Ranking*: Automatically rank candidates based on match scores.
* *Comprehensive Candidate Profiles*: Clearly presented resume data for fast review.
* *User-Centric Design*: Built for simplicity and speed, making it accessible for all HR users.
