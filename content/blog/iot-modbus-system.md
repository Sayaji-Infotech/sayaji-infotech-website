## Project Summary

We developed a comprehensive IoT data collection system that integrates Modbus TCP communication with REST API endpoints. This system enables real-time monitoring and data collection from industrial devices (specifically RUT200 routers) through a robust, scalable architecture that handles both online and offline scenarios.

The solution addresses critical challenges in industrial IoT deployments, including network reliability, data persistence, and real-time monitoring capabilities. By combining Modbus TCP for device communication and FastAPI for robust API endpoints, we created a production-ready system that ensures data integrity and operational continuity.

## Key Features

1. **Real-time Modbus TCP Communication**: Direct integration with industrial devices using Modbus TCP protocol for reliable data acquisition
2. **Offline Data Persistence**: Local storage mechanism that preserves data during network outages
3. **RESTful API Endpoints**: FastAPI-based backend for data ingestion and status monitoring
4. **Bulk Data Processing**: Efficient handling of both single and bulk data records
5. **Network Resilience**: Automatic fallback mechanisms for offline scenarios
6. **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging system for monitoring and debugging
7. **Scalable Architecture**: Modular design supporting multiple devices and data types
8. **Simple Integration**: Easy-to-use API endpoints for data collection

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), Uvicorn ASGI server
- **IoT Communication**: Modbus TCP protocol
- **Data Processing**: Python JSON handling, Shell scripting for device integration
- **Storage**: Local file-based storage with JSON format
- **Network**: HTTP/REST APIs, TCP/IP communication
- **Monitoring**: Custom logging system with timestamp tracking

## Technical Approach

### Architecture Overview

The system follows a three-tier architecture:

1. **Device Layer**: RUT200 routers with Modbus TCP capabilities
2. **Communication Layer**: REST API endpoints
3. **Application Layer**: FastAPI backend with data processing and storage

### Data Flow Architecture

```
[RUT200 Router] → [Modbus TCP] → [Shell Script] → [FastAPI Backend] → [Local Storage]
                                    ↓
                              [Offline Storage] ← [Network Check] → [API Endpoint]
```

### Core Components

**Modbus Integration Script (`modbus_sync.sh`)**
- Reads 8 registers from Modbus TCP devices
- Handles network connectivity and offline scenarios
- Implements data persistence during outages
- Supports bulk data transmission

**FastAPI Backend (`main.py`)**
- Single endpoint for data ingestion (`/receive-data`)
- Supports both single and bulk data formats
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Status monitoring endpoints

## Technical Overview

### Data Structure

The system handles structured JSON data with the following format:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15 10:30:45",
  "device_id": "RUT200_1",
  "registers": {
    "reg1": 123,
    "reg2": 456,
    "reg3": 789,
    "reg4": 0,
    "reg5": 0,
    "reg6": 0,
    "reg7": 0,
    "reg8": 0
  },
  "status": "success"
}
```

### Network Resilience

The system implements sophisticated offline handling:

1. **Connectivity Monitoring**: Continuous API server availability checks
2. **Local Storage**: JSON-based offline data persistence
3. **Bulk Transmission**: Efficient data synchronization when connectivity is restored
4. **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry mechanisms and error logging

### Scalability Features

- **Multi-device Support**: Configurable slave IDs for multiple devices
- **Modular Design**: Separate components for different functions
- **Configurable Intervals**: Adjustable data collection frequencies
- **Extensible API**: Easy integration with additional endpoints
